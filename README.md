# Photo-Album-using-AWS
Cloud Computing - Amazon Web Services



This project provides a picture viewing and album creating service and UI.

It has the following features :
All users are required to identify themselves by "logging in". After identifying themselves you will present a web page interface to allow them to
either view pictures, as well as a “title” i.e up to 68 characters, time and date created(or last modified), and a “likes” score, from 0 to 5 stars, for each picture.

The web page will display (in large characters) the user’s identity welcome, such as “Picture Viewing For Steve” followed by a series of photos, each followed(or next to the picture) a title, created time and date, and likes score, as well as a method for the viewer to “vote” likes for any photo(any option for voting: box, slider, buttons, etc.)The initial web interface will also allow a user to “create” content, upload photos(not more than 1 MB), and give a title for each. The album information should be stored in a relational database(SQL), but the individual photos can be stored in any desired method.
