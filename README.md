Cloud Computing - Amazon Web Services



This Project provides a picture viewing and album creating service and UI.

It has the following features :
All users are required to identify themselves (“login”).After identify themselves you will present a web page interface to allow them to
either view pictures, as well as a “title” (up to 68 characters), time and datecreated (or last modified), and a “likes” score, from 0 to 5 stars, for each picture.

The web page will display (in large characters) the user’s identity welcome,such as “Picture Viewing For Steve” followed by a series of photos, each followed (or next to the picture) a title, created time and date, and likes score, as well as a method for the viewer to “vote” likes for any photo (any option for voting:box, slider, buttons, etc.)The initial web interface will also allow a user to “create” content: uploadphotos (no larger than 1 MB), and give a title for each.The album information should be stored in a relational database (SQL), butthe individual photos may be stored in any method desired.
